# Active-vs-Passive-and-ESG-Investing
Just some thoughts on passive and active investing and the trend towards more ESG investments. 

I show how passive investing has historically done better than active investing over the long run. I show that an ESG S&P 500 index fund
is more stable than a regular S&P 500 index fund by regressing them on VIX.
